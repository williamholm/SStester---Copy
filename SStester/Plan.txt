Short term tasks:

make sure no doubling of inheritance occurs. DONE

How to create/delete entities; 
should be able to copy existing entity of the same type (maybe more advanced is partial copy, but that can be done manually)
should be able to easily pass that needed data to create - ideally without needing to manually make datapacks.

-Should ETs contain other ETs? or should that be kept there too.
-How should ETInfos be made / stored. current method is kinda horrible - Engine editor?.
-Get a clearer idea of what should be contained in mEntityFlags/mEntityGroup.
-Multi-Threading
-SIMD

Large Questions:

should pos3D be split into x,y,z component, same with things like orientation?

does sorting the way 2SS does it even make sense most of the time? switching every cycle is pretty bad, is there a way to access 
order in a sorted way rather than doing it like this?

EM plan

-Rules for creation/deletion

-How to deal with getting data from multiple queries. Might need changes in 2SS.

ET plan

-Set up test classes for ET. DONE

-Decide on better inheritance as at the moment it can easily break if you inherit from two parents which share a common parent. (need to updated
ET components though as that is still old) DONE

-Add Children. DONE

-Should ETs have multiple names or should this be done elsewhere eg should gaurd = bandit should there ETs for both to search. currently yes
is there negative to large amount of groups? is there a better way than just doing the obvious?

Comp plan

-get SS for each component which lists all ETs with that component in it. DONE
-Decide on multiple components in an ET - Should be an option, for now unique to components that are not sortable.

2SS

- Transfer to ET system DONE
- See class for improvements
