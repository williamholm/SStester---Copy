Short term tasks:

make sure no doubling of inheritance occurs.

figure out how to get data access the data in ET<id>. atm for loops and functions don't work so you are stuck with using structs - try EM search functions to
see if this problem is unsolvable. if it is move PET into new solution and have it compile data into a constexpr, non-static access only way.

-Should ETs contain other ETs? or should that be kept there too.
-How should ETInfos be made / stored. current method is kinda horrible - Engine editor?.
-Get a clearer idea of what should be contained in mEntityFlags/mEntityGroup.
-Multi-Threading

EM plan

-???

ET plan

-Set up test classes for ET. DONE

-Decide on better inheritance as at the moment it can easily break if you inherit from two parents which share a common parent. (need to updated
ET components though as that is still old) DONE

-Add Children. DONE

-Should ETs have multiple names or should this be done elsewhere eg should gaurd = bandit should there ETs for both to search. currently yes
is there negative to large amount of groups? is there a better way than just doing the obvious?

-Decide on more than one of each component per ET. - 2ss doesn't work well as there is no obv way (other than flags) to indicate if things 
are sorted by value. If stuff isn't sorted by value, then 2SS works for this. 


Comp plan

-get SS for each component which lists all ETs with that component in it. DONE
-Decide on multiple components in an ET - Should be an option, for now unique to components that are not sortable.


2SS

- Transfer to ET system DONE
- See class for improvements
